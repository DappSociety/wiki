# DappSociety Chat Guide

> This guide contains information specific to Slack, our current chat application. If we move to a different service in the future, this guide will be updated accordingly.

Our Slack team has an ever growing list of channels. To help you get around the list, we have developed a consistent naming scheme. In addition to using a naming scheme, dead channels are periodically archived.

When you first join the Slack team, you will be shown a default list of starting channels. This is not the complete list of available channels. To browse all channels, click the "Channels" heading above your channels list (click the `(+)` symbol on mobile). For more detailed instructions, refer to [this help article by Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/205239967-Browse-and-join-channels#desktop-1).

For more details about each channel, refer to its topic or purpose (viewable in the channel info sidebar on desktop or the channel drop down menu on mobile).

## General Purpose Channels
Our general purpose channels are all of those without a two letter prefix. Many of them are from our first few days when organization wasn't a priority. In the future, they may be given prefixes to provide greater organization.

We try to make these channel names as self-explanatory as we can within the character limits. Some of them are covered in our [Getting Started Guide](#) and all of them have a viewable purpose and/or topic within Slack.

## Question & Answer Channels
Any channel prefixed with `#qa-` is a place to ask questions and get help. No question is a stupid question, so if you need help on anything you are working on, be sure to ask here.

We currently have a small list of these channels, but anything that does not fit into a specific QA channel can always be posted in `#qa-general-help`.

For more information on asking or answering questions, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](#)

## Working Group Channels
Any channel prefixed with `#wg-` is a place for teams to organize around a project. You can view them all by browsing the channel list and looking for this prefix.

For more information on joining or creating working groups, refer to our [Getting Started Guide](#)

## Community Meeting Channels
Any channel prefixed with  `#cm-` is a dedicated channel for a single community meeting. All discussion takes place in this single channel. After some time, these channels are stored and archived.
