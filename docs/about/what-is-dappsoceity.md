# What is DappSociety?

DappSociety is a self-organizing, self-governing group of developers, designers, and enthusiasts who are dedicated to advancing blockchain technology.

We are a networking and learning hub, an incubator of ideas, a provider of services, and a producer of knowledge.

We focus on contributing to blockchain technology and developing dapps with the primary goals of learning, benefiting society, and/or benefiting the blockchain ecosystem.

>One project in isolation can create a product to disrupt an industry, but by working together we can create a framework that will change the world." -Jun Hasegawa on the #Ethereum ecosystem players uniting to build more infrastructure ([Link to Tweet](https://twitter.com/ETHNews_/status/964261808780533760))

## What Motivates Us?

We are not primarily motivated by financial gain, but by a shared passion for blockchain technology.

Working on a project that has *zero* aspirations of financial gain, with the sole purpose of getting a team to band together and learn, is deemed a massive success by our standards. Even if it is never taken to completion.

The output of such a project would be libraries, packages, tutorials, and/or guides that solve problems other blockchain enthusiasts also encounter.
