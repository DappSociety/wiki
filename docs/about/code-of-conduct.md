# DappSociety Code of Conduct

The DappSociety community is a polite and supportive group of people who strive to help each other out in any way possible. We look out for one another and try to make sure no one gets taken advantage of. We try our best to put the interests of the group above the interest of the self.

## Personal Conduct

>This "Personal Conduct" section has been adapted/borrowed from [Aragon's Code of Conduct](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/blob/master/docs/documentation/Code_of_Conduct.md) as it does a great job of outlining how we should treat each other.

DappSociety is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all of the DappSociety spaces. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces by community vote.

Some of the DappSociety spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to **creating a positive environment** include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of **unacceptable behavior** by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Organizing and participating in "pump and dump" campaigns for any assets
* Sharing links to illegal websites, such as phishing, malware, online gambling, or nonconsensual imagery
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment
* Deliberate misgendering or use of 'dead' or rejected names
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
* Publication of non-harassing private communication
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any trusted DappSociety member.

This code of conduct applies to all DappSociety community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the community or team member outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.

The community reserves the right to exclude people from DappSociety through consensus vote, based on their past behavior.

In order to protect from abuse and burnout, any member has the right to reject any report they believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Dappsociety community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

### Enforcement

DappSociety community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by group consensus.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all DappSociety spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other community members or the general public.

## Supportive Learning Environment

DappSociety is inclusive of members from all levels of experience in any subject matter.

If willing to put in the effort to learn, no member should be excluded from a team project because they lack experience. Instead, their role in the project should simply be adjusted to account for their level of experience.

When working on a team project, all members should be upfront about their skill levels so other members can have appropriate expectations regarding what can be provided and how much help will be needed.

Any member and any team should feel comfortable to reach out to the community as a whole for help. And all community members should make their best effort to provide help wherever they can.

**This is one of the most important qualities our community can develop in its early stages.**

## Respecting the Ideas of Others

Unfortunately, ideas themselves cannot be protected. There is always the possibility of a lurker in the community stealing your idea.

In the long run, having a scarcity mindset will hold you back. Inspiration is only 1% of the work. The real challenge is successfully implementing an idea. And that is where the benefit of this community outweighs the risks.

We cannot focus too much on the possibility of ideas being “stolen.” Realistically, anyone can copy anything that is being done here and do it elsewhere outside of the group and there would be no way to control it.

Instead, we should adopt a mindset of looking out for each other and always doing what is in the best interest of the community. This is often easier said than done when the stakes are high, but hopefully enough good actors can overshadow any bad actors.

As a community, we should adhere to our Code of Conduct and not blatantly copy another's ideas without including them. Of course, anyone could still do that, but they may no longer be welcomed within the DappSociety.

### For Those Scared to Share Ideas

As a community, we should be open to anyone who has an idea and is scared to publish it for fear it will be stolen.

Such a person can reasonably expect a small amount of protection that we as a community will not steal the idea.

There are some additional ways you can protect your idea:

* Write up a description, outline, or whitepaper and publish it to GitHub. This creates a historical record showing the origination of your idea and will be helpful for any future arbitration.

* Earn enough respect within DappSociety to get a few trusted members to help you bootstrap your idea. Then come back to the group as a whole to post the idea with some mileage.

We are all here to learn. If enough people support an idea, many members would be thrilled to work on it with others. Within this community, the benefits of stealing an idea from a well-intentioned person are minimal compared to the downsides.

## Paid Work

Working on proprietary projects and/or hiring members within the community is not frowned upon **as long as** the work being done also contributes back to DappSociety and the blockchain community as a whole.

In alignment with out group purpose, projects of commercial nature should focus on "giving back."

This is similar to how tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and more contribute to the Open Source community. They are for-profit (often considered evil) corporations, but they still give back a *lot* of good.

There are many components that could be open source even for proprietary projects. Not even everything would have to be open source. If a few open source packages and a few helpful tutorials come out of a closed source project, that's still very helpful.

Additional benefits of a paid agreement include:

* Project owner needs tech faster and is willing to invest money to get it. In doing so, they accelerate the rate at which they face and solve common challenges.

* Developer wants to spend more time working on blockchain projects but needs an income to survive. Being paid allows them to acquire knowledge at a faster rate, ultimately leveling up the community talent pool.

To reiterate, there is nothing wrong with two *consenting* group members working within a paid agreement. Just make sure if you are participating in one that you have worked out all the details before hand rather than relying on the community for conflict resolution.

## DappSociety Attribution

There is no requirement for any finished product that has come out of DappSociety to provide attribution.

However, the hope is that finished products would want to showcase the community as a badge of honor or a seal of approval and also to help DappSociety grow.
