# Community Governance Model

Our community governance model is still in very early stages of development. It will take several iterations to fine tune something that ends up working really well for the majority of the group. Hopefully we can accomplish this goal by working alongside (or with tools from) other projects like [Aragon](https://aragon.one/).

We are looking to develop a framework that can be applied to any project, large or small. Within the context of DappSociety, we must distinguish between two types of projects:

1. Projects that *are* DappSociety (internal projects)
2. Projects that came out of DappSociety (side projects)

## Community Affecting Projects

For decision that impact the entire community, everyone gets a chance to vote.

DappSociety can be thought of as a testing ground for experimentation in self-governance. The things we learn governing our large group can then be applied to the governance of smaller groups.

To maintain focus and a constant rate of progress, we will appoint smaller working groups for each of these projects. These teams will set milestones and report back to the community for feedback on progress.

Examples of these community affecting projects include:

* Website
* Document editing
* Logo/branding
* Social media profiles
* Governance model
* Token reward model

Since we are still working on our governance model, we don't yet know how we will handle disputes at this level. This is a learning experiment in self-governance.

## Side Projects Born Out of DappSociety

For decisions within a particular side project/dapp, the participants of that project are free to decide how to handle it.

The community as a whole does not dictate how a small group self-organizes.

Side projects may use models from DappSociety (e.g. governance and reward) or whatever else works best for them. They can choose their own rules and tools for their implementation.


### Rallying a Team for Your Side Project

Anyone can pitch an idea and rally members from DappSociety around it. You should make clear where your idea is going, what your vision is, how any financial gain is split, etc.

Based on your pitch, other members can choose to join that project under those terms or not.

You may also reach back into DappSociety for support and encouragement at any time.


### Forks and Disputes

>As a group, DappSociety needs to establish a Code of Conduct for how we treat members who participate in a side project fork. Picking sides when the lines are blurred is a touchy area and can result in quality members feeling alienated. This is something we want to avoid as much as possible.

If your idea is good, and the terms are fair, there should not be a split. If you're worried about that, don't share publicly until you have built enough of a moat around your idea.

Hard forks can actually be a feature that promote good behavior. Splitting off reduces the odds that your project is successful. If you are splitting for a good reason, then people will follow you, increasing the odds of success. In that way your idea is protected.

With any open source project, there is always the risk of a fork. That risk needs to be acknowledged before beginning any endeavor.

## Reputation
DappSociety will be working on a reputation system for use within the community, but that also permeates into side projects.

This could be in the form of a reputation aggregator, a global reputation score, or even a combination of the two.

**The details of implementing this have barely been discussed, so there isn't much more to say here.**
