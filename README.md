# DappSociety Wiki

https://wiki.dappsociety.io

The DappSociety Wiki stores all documents and knowledge created by the community.

Most documents are stored here while others have been split off into their own repositories and are pulled in during build time.

Help build our wealth of knowledge by fixing errors, submitting additions, or adding entirely new pages. To do so, please submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/DappSociety/wiki/pulls) to the appropriate repository.

You can do this by  [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) or [cloning](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) the repository. If you are not comfortable using Git, you can even [create](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-new-files/), [upload](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/), or [edit](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) files directly on GitHub

**Contribution Requirements:**
- All content must be in markdown format.
- Create a short, descriptive branch name for your changes.
- Always submit a pull request so changes can be peer reviewed (even if you are an owner or primary editor of this repository).

More requirements will be added to the list above as they are discovered during pull request reviews.
